# International Debt Statistics Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst internship at Physics Wallah. It involves analyzing international debt statistics using data sourced from the World Bank.

## Steps and Tools Used
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Downloaded the dataset from the World Bank database.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using Python and Pandas.
   - Used web scraping to obtain flag image links and merged these with the data.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Connected the cleaned data to MySQL using Python.
   - Answered project task questions using SQL queries.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created an interactive Power BI dashboard.
   - Connected the dashboard to the MySQL database for dynamic data visualization.

## Files Included
- `Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and transformation.
- `Data_to_MySQL.ipynb`: Python script to connect and load data into MySQL.
- `Project Task Solutions.sql`: SQL file containing queries to answer project tasks.
- `Debt Analysis Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python, Pandas, MySQL, and Power BI installed.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Run `Data_Cleaning.ipynb` to clean and transform the data.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Run `Data_to_MySQL.ipynb` to load data into MySQL.

4. **Querying**:
   - Use the queries in `Project Task Solutions.sql` to analyze the data.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Open `Debt Analysis Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI and connect it to your MySQL database.

## Insights and Conclusions
- China and India hold the highest amounts of external debt.
- Significant debt repayment obligations are evident in several countries.
- Trends over time show increasing debt levels, particularly during economic crises.
- Debt distribution varies across income groups, with upper-middle-income countries holding the majority.
